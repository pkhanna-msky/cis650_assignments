    Apply a Buy-One-Get-One deal to items in shopping_cart that match `name` (case-insensitive).
    Every second occurrence (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) of that item gets a discounted unit price.
    Non-matching items (and non-discounted matches) keep the original price.

    Side effect: adds/overwrites `discounted_price` on each cart line.
